                            <p>Bananas are rich in soluble fiber. During digestion, soluble fiber dissolves in liquid to form a gel. This may also contribute to a banana’s sponge-like textureTrusted Source.

                                Unripe (green) bananas also contain resistant starch, a type of fiber that your body does not digest.
                                
                                Together, these two types of fiber may help moderate your blood sugar levels after meals and regulate your appetite by slowing the emptying of your stomach.
                                
                                This means that despite their higher carb content, bananas may not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in people who don’t have diabetes.
                                
                                However, for those who have diabetes, eating a large portion in one sitting may cause blood sugar levels to rise too high, so it’s best to stick to one banana at a time.</p>

                            <p>Apples are high in fiber and water, which makes them filling.

                                In one studyTrusted Source, eating whole apples increased fullness more than consuming equal amounts of apple juice. This may happen because whole apples reduce gastric emptying — the rate at which your stomach empties.
                                
                                ResearchTrusted Source also suggests apple intake may significantly reduce Body Mass Index (BMI), a weight-related risk factor for heart disease.
